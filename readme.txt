I have made the cars run on the line by using the class. 
I set up the class of CAR to make the cars can be controled one by one.
And I set uo anothor class of the lights. Because it is different for the different directions, so I set up two classes and named them by "LIGHT1" and " LIGHT2'.
I first using the milestone1 to draw the lines of the crossing.
Then I definite the cars by the for loop and the class CAR
then I just the function inside the CAR and show the rectangle of the cars.
then I use the loop delete and set up the CAR again and again to make us look like being in motion.
And at the same time I use the function inside the class LIGHT1 and LIGHT2 to show the traffic lights.
And pause 1 second everytime
